Contains basic configuration to get you a site with:

- [Sample posts](./_posts/) and [paginated blog index](./blog/index.html).
- [Sample collection](./_cheatsheet/) with Markdown and kramdown cheatsheets and [collection index](./_pages/cheatsheet.md).
- Archive pages for posts grouped by year, category, and tag.
- Demo page with the different Bootstrap components and how they look with the actual skin settings.
- Sample 404 page.
- Site search with Lunr.
- Sample [`_config`](_config.yml) with minimal configuration.
- Sample [`algolia-search.yml`](algolia-search.yml) for using Algolia+GitHub Actions. More guidance in the top of the file.
- Sample files for extending the theme with your [own scripts](./_includes/custom/) and [css](./assets/css/).

[Configure as necessary](https://dieghernan.github.io/chulapa/docs/02-config) and replace sample content with your own.
